# Logic Layer Experiment

- Build a logic layer POC
- Attempted to utilize the mediator pattern and have the components communicate directly with the core

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
3. npm install
4. 'npm run start' to start the server
5. Visit http://localhost:8080/

### Background information
- With no prior knowledge of a logic layer or what the role of the 'core' is, did some research to determine plan
- Followed the structure Nicolas Zakas outlined in a talk about scalable JS application architecture
- Goal was to get something working with improvements if time allowed

### Experimenting Issues
- Determining an appropriate set-up that functions as a logic layer should
- Time to take the experiment past 'functioning'
- Starting the plugins in a logical way

### Experimenting To Dos
- convert plugins to classes
- 'start' method in Core - needs to be reworked
- add ability to configure plugins
- move past getting it working phase to considering dev use cases
